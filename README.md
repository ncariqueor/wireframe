You must install dependences with this command:

npm install

Once dependences has installed, go to wireframe/backend and execute the next
command:

node index.js

Only with this command, the database will fill automatically every 1 hour

Then go to wireframe/client and execute:

node app.js

The app will listen on port 3000, so you can 
go to http://localhost/3000 .

Enjoy app!
