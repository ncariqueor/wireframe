You must install the next dependences:

**npm install express

npm install request

npm install mongoose

npm install pug

npm install body-parser**

Once installed, go to wireframe/backend and execute the next
command:

node index.js

Only with this command the database will fill automatically every 1 hour

Then go to wireframe/client and execute:

node app.js

The app will listen on port 3000, so you can 
go to http://localhost/3000 and enjoy app.
